The aim of this project is to explore the hypothesis of a computer virus threat, and how destructive it can be if executed on a targeted machine. What are the possible counter measures to protect computers from these threats? Information security risks associated with computer viruses can infect computers and other storage devices by copying themselves into a file and other executable programs. These files get infection and allow attackers to connect to target systems by using backdoors. The results of this project show that, the proper security implementations and the use of up to date operating systems patches and anti-virus programs helps users to prevent the loss of data and any viral attack on the system. Nevertheless, this observation could be used for further research in the network security and related fields; this study will also help computer users to use the possible steps and techniques to protect their systems and information from any possible attacks on their network systems.
